Extract only dialogue sections and create detailed conversation analysis from chapter-[chapter_number].md.

For each dialogue exchange:

1. Original Line:
   민수: "지은아, 오늘 뭐 해?"

2. Breakdown:
   - Literal: "Ji-eun-ah, today what do?"
   - Natural English: "Hey Ji-eun, what are you doing today?"
   - Speech Level: 반말 (casual - they're friends)
   - Grammar: 뭐 (what) + 해 (하다 in casual present)
   - Particle: 아 (vocative particle for names ending in consonant)
   - Natural response patterns: Could answer with schedule/activity

3. Alternative Ways to Say It:
   - More formal: "지은 씨, 오늘 뭐 하세요?"
   - More casual: "야, 오늘 뭐 해?"
   - Different nuance: "오늘 뭐 할 거야?" (future tense)
