Analyze progression through chapters 1 to [up_to_chapter]:

1. Vocabulary growth rate (should be 7-10 per chapter)
2. Grammar complexity curve (gradual increase)
3. Story continuity and character development
4. Identify any sudden difficulty spikes

Output a report with:
- Growth metrics
- Progression graph (text representation)
- Recommendations for smoothing if needed
