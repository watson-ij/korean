When a learner struggles with specific grammar, generate targeted practice.

Analyze the problematic grammar point [grammar_point] and create:

1. Mini-dialogue (200 words)
   - Uses the grammar point 10+ times
   - Very simple vocabulary
   - Repetitive but natural patterns

2. Pattern practice story (300 words)
   - Systematic variations of the grammar
   - Contrasts with similar patterns
   - Clear context for each usage

3. Exercises:
   - 10 transformation exercises
   - 5 error correction items
   - 5 sentence completion

Example for past tense (았/었어요):
- Dialogue about what happened yesterday
- Every sentence uses past tense
- Gradual complexity increase

Output as: supplements/drill-[chapter_number]-[grammar_point].md
