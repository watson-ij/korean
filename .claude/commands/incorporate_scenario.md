Take this real scenario and weave it naturally into chapter [chapter_number]:
Scenario: [scenario]

Work this into the story by:
1. Having characters experience a similar misunderstanding
2. Show the confusion naturally
3. Resolve it through context/explanation
4. Use the actual vocabulary and grammar patterns involved
5. Keep it feeling like part of the story, not a forced insertion

Update plan-chapter-[chapter_number].md to include this scenario
