Review the following files:
- CLAUDE.md for the grammar progression plan and story arc
- vocabulary-tracker.md for all previously introduced vocabulary
- The previous chapter (if it exists)

Then create a plan that includes:

1. Grammar Focus:
   - Main grammar point to introduce (from progression plan)
   - How it will be introduced naturally in context

2. Story Outline:
   - 3-4 main story beats
   - Which characters appear
   - Setting/location
   - How the story advances the overall arc

3. Vocabulary Plan:
   - 7-10 new words to introduce
   - How each will be made clear from context
   - Which previous vocabulary to reinforce

4. Dialogue Situations:
   - 2-3 conversational contexts that naturally use the new grammar
   - Real-life situations students can relate to

Output as: plan-chapter-[chapter_number].md
