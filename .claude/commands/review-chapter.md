Review chapters/chapter-[chapter_number].md for:

1. Korean Language Check:
   - Natural-sounding dialogue (Would a Korean university student say this?)
   - Correct particle usage
   - Appropriate speech levels (반말 between friends)
   - Natural contractions (하는 → 하는, 그러면 → 그럼)

2. Pedagogical Check:
   - Are new words clearly deducible from context?
   - Is the grammar point appearing naturally?
   - Sufficient repetition of new elements?
   - Appropriate difficulty progression?

3. Story Flow:
   - Does it connect to the previous chapter?
   - Character consistency maintained?
   - Engaging and relatable situations?

4. Exercise Quality:
   - Clear and unambiguous questions?
   - Appropriate difficulty level?
   - Testing comprehension, not tricks?

Output a report with:
- Issues found (if any)
- Suggested corrections
- Confirmation if ready to use

If corrections needed, output: chapter-[chapter_number]-revised.md
