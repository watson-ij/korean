---

Using plan-chapter-[chapter_number].md and following the structure in CLAUDE.md:

1. Write the 이야기 section:
   - 500-800 words
   - Bold new vocabulary on first use
   - Natural progression from simple to complex sentences
   - Include dialogue that sounds conversational
   - Ensure new grammar appears at least 5 times in different contexts

2. Create 연습 문제:
   - 8 맞아요/틀려요 questions (mix of obvious and careful reading)
   - 8 comprehension questions in Korean (answers should be in the text)
   - 8-10 fill-in-the-blank (focus on particles and new grammar)
   - 5 matching or multiple choice items

3. Add 새 단어 정리:
   - List all new vocabulary with minimal English hints
   - Group by part of speech

Remember:
- Use ONLY vocabulary from vocabulary-tracker.md plus the new planned words
- Keep sentences short initially, gradually increase complexity
- Every new word should be deducible from context

Output as: chapters/chapter-[chapter_number].md
