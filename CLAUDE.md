# Korean Natural Method Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project creates a series of Korean language learning materials using the natural method approach, inspired by Hans Ørberg's "Lingua Latina per se Illustrata". All content is in Korean from the beginning, with new vocabulary and grammar introduced gradually through context.

## Teaching Methodology

### Core Principles
1. **Korean-only immersion**: No English translations in the main text
2. **Contextual learning**: New words should be understandable from context
3. **Repetition**: New vocabulary appears multiple times in different contexts
4. **Gradual complexity**: Start simple, build systematically
5. **Story-driven**: Continuous narrative maintains engagement

### Formatting Conventions
- **Bold** for new vocabulary on first appearance
- Natural dialogue to introduce conversational patterns
- Short sentences initially, gradually increasing complexity
- Use cognates and context clues where possible

### Michael as Language Learning Mirror
Michael (the foreign postdoc) serves as a subtle parallel to the reader's journey:
- **Early chapters**: Makes mistakes readers might also make, often unaware
- **Middle chapters**: Catches some nuances but misses others (wordplay, indirectness)
- **Later chapters**: More confident but still occasionally confused by advanced cultural/linguistic elements
- His confusion moments are written naturally - sometimes explained immediately, sometimes only clear from context
- Humor and misunderstandings arise organically from language barriers, not forced teaching moments
- **Pronunciation challenges**: Sometimes Michael repeats something several times before being understood, then someone repeats it back and everyone understands. The text can show this through:
  * Others asking "뭐라고요?" or "다시 한 번..."
  * Someone finally echoing his word with "아! [word]!" 
  * Michael thinking he said the same thing
  * Optional: [What he actually said] in brackets to show pronunciation issues
    - 마이크: "논문 봤어요?" [넌문]
    - 마이크: "결과 나왔어요." [겨과]
    - 마이크: "살아요" [싸라요]
    - This helps readers understand why confusion occurred
  * Subtle improvements over chapters (fewer repetition incidents)
  * Common realistic trouble spots for Seoul Korean:
    - ㅓ/ㅗ distinction (더/도, 넌문/논문)
    - Single/double consonants (살아/싸라, 자리/짜리)
    - ㄹ difficulties (물리 [무리], 입자물리 [입자무리])
    - Final consonants (있어요 [이써요], 없어요 [업써요])
    - Intonation in questions vs statements
- These moments validate that communication struggles aren't always about grammar knowledge

### Progressive Understanding Design
Stories should reward re-reading:
- **First read**: Reader may miss why something is funny/awkward, focusing on basic comprehension
- **Second read**: Cultural jokes and linguistic mistakes become apparent
- **Third read**: Reader catches subtle nuances and appreciates character dynamics fully
- Michael's errors evolve from basic (particles, formal/informal) to advanced (indirectness, academic register)
- Other characters' reactions provide context clues without explicit explanation

- **CERN storyline**: Jun-ho goes to CERN for 3 months
  - Chapter 11: Jun-ho's arrival at CERN, finding apartment in Meyrin
  - Chapter 13: Working in the detector hall, international colleagues
  - Chapter 15: Weekend trip to Chamonix with other Korean physicists
- **Connecting scenes**: Weekly Zoom meetings where both storylines merge
- Korean HEP workshop where everyone reunites
- Michael's improving Korean creates natural moments (not forced every chapter)

### Act 3 (Ch 17-25): Career & Discovery
- Jun-ho returns with job offers
- Possible anomaly in data (excitement then systematic)
- Min-su considers CERN trip for collaboration meeting
- Ji-eun's detector installed at CERN
- Conference presentation (ICHEP/Moriond)
- Postdoc applications (CERN, Fermilab, KEK)
- Multiple paths: Jun-ho → CERN postdoc, Min-su → considering industry, Ha-na → PhD decision
- Next generation experiment planning

## Chapter Structure Template

1. **이야기** (500-800 words)
   - Natural dialogue
   - Description and narration
   - 7-10 new vocabulary items max
   - **Story variety**: 
     * Not every chapter needs Michael
     * Some chapters focus on Jun-ho at CERN (different vocabulary: European life, international English-Korean code-switching)
     * Some chapters are Min-su/Ha-na focused (analysis problems, Korean academic life)
     * Zoom meetings connect storylines naturally
     * Michael appears when it serves the story, not as a teaching device

2. **연습 문제**:
   - 맞아요? 틀려요? (8 questions)
   - 질문에 대답하세요 (6-8 questions)
   - 빈칸 채우기 (8-10 items)
   - 연결하기 or 고르기 (5 items)

3. **새 단어 정리**
   - List with minimal English hints
   - Group by part of speech

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing each chapter:
1. Are new words deducible from context?
2. Does dialogue sound natural?
3. Are previous grammar patterns reinforced?
4. Is the story engaging and progressing?
5. Do exercises test comprehension without being frustrating?
6. Is difficulty appropriate for chapter number?
7. If Michael appears, are his language moments organic and realistic?
8. Will re-readers discover new layers of understanding?
9. **Story consistency verified**:
   - Timeline makes logical sense (no meeting at 3 if class ends at 4)
   - Character locations are possible
   - Character knowledge is appropriate (Ha-na doesn't know advanced things yet)
   - Facts remain consistent (room numbers, equipment names)
