# Plan for Chapter 02: 지은이 와요

## 1. Grammar Focus

### Main Grammar Points:
- **Reinforcing 있다/없다** (existence/location) - already introduced briefly in Ch1
- **Expanding location particles**: 에, 에서 with more variety
- **Question words reinforcement**: 어디 (where) as main new addition
- **Time expressions**: 지금 (now), 오전/오후 (morning/afternoon)

### Natural Introduction Strategy:
- Ji-eun arrives at the lab, creating natural "where" questions
- Discussion of where things/people are located
- Contrast between 에 (static location) and 에서 (action location)
- Use lab environment to show physical locations

## 2. Story Outline

### Story Beats:
1. **Ji-eun arrives at the lab** (morning)
   - Introduces 지은 as hardware/detector expert
   - Natural greetings and small talk about location/arrival

2. **Looking for equipment**
   - Ji-eun needs tools/equipment that are in different locations
   - Creates natural "where is X?" questions
   - Discussion about what's in the lab vs. what's in other rooms

3. **Discussing detector work**
   - Ji-eun talks about her Silicon detector project
   - Mention of where different components are (CERN, Korea, other labs)
   - Time expressions for when work happens

4. **Lunch planning / coffee**
   - Continuation of social dynamics
   - More location discussion (cafeteria, coffee shop, etc.)
   - Sets up regular character interactions

### Characters:
- 민수 (Min-su) - continue as main POV
- 준호 (Jun-ho) - brief appearance
- **지은 (Ji-eun)** - introduction as new main character
- 하나 (Ha-na) - brief mention or appearance

### Setting:
- Main: Physics lab (연구실)
- Brief mention: Other rooms (detector lab, workshop)
- Background: Campus locations

### Story Arc Advancement:
- Expands the character circle
- Establishes Ji-eun as the hardware expert (complementing Min-su's analysis work)
- Sets up collaboration dynamics
- Builds the everyday rhythm of lab life

## 3. Vocabulary Plan

### New Words (7-10):
1. **지금** (now) - time expression, contrasted with 오늘, 내일
   - Context: "지금 뭐 해요?" natural conversation opener

2. **어디** (where) - KEY question word for this chapter
   - Context: Multiple "where is X?" situations

3. **방** (room) - for location discussions
   - Context: "준호는 어디에 있어요?" "201호 방에 있어요"

4. **찾다** (to look for/find) - action verb for searching
   - Context: Ji-eun looking for equipment

5. **필요하다** (to need) - useful stative verb
   - Context: "뭐가 필요해요?" "이게 필요해요"

6. **오전/오후** (morning/afternoon) - time vocabulary
   - Context: "오전에 미팅이 있어요"

7. **층** (floor) - building navigation
   - Context: "2층에 있어요"

8. **실리콘** (silicon) - technical term, cognate
   - Context: Ji-eun's detector work

9. **검출기** (detector) - key technical vocabulary
   - Context: Natural for experimental physics

10. **파이썬** (Python) - programming language, cognate
    - Context: Alternative to ROOT, Ji-eun's preference

### Context Strategies:
- **지금**: Contrasted with 오늘, 내일 from Ch1
- **어디**: Multiple parallel structures "X는 어디에 있어요?"
- **방/층**: Physical pointing/going to locations
- **찾다**: Visible searching behavior
- **필요하다**: Request/offer situations
- **오전/오후**: Clock times + morning/afternoon markers
- **실리콘/검출기**: Technical discussion with context clues
- **파이썬**: Alternative to ROOT (already known)

### Previous Vocabulary to Reinforce:
- 있어요/없어요 (Ch1) - heavily used
- 에/에서 particles (Ch1) - clarify distinction
- 무슨 (Ch1) - continue question patterns
- 뭐 (Ch1) - in new contexts
- All character names and basic lab vocabulary

## 4. Dialogue Situations

### Situation 1: Ji-eun Arrives
**Purpose**: Natural greetings, introduce 어디 questions
**Grammar**: Location particles, 있다/없다
```
- Min-su working at computer
- Ji-eun enters, they greet
- "준호 선배 어디 있어요?" "저도 몰라요. 2층에 있을 거예요?"
- Small talk about what they're doing now (지금)
```

### Situation 2: Looking for Equipment
**Purpose**: Practice 어디, 찾다, 필요하다
**Grammar**: Object particles, location expressions
```
- Ji-eun needs an oscilloscope or cables
- Asking where equipment is kept
- Checking different rooms (몇 층, 몇 호)
- Finding vs. not finding (있어요/없어요)
```

### Situation 3: Work Discussion
**Purpose**: Technical vocabulary in context, time expressions
**Grammar**: Present tense actions, time markers
```
- What is Ji-eun working on? (Silicon detector)
- Where are the components? (some at CERN, some here)
- When is testing? (오전? 오후?)
- Comparison with Min-su's analysis work
```

### Situation 4: Coffee/Lunch Transition
**Purpose**: Reinforce location/time, social dynamics
**Grammar**: Suggestions (ㄹ까?), location verbs (가다)
```
- "커피 마실까요?" "좋아요"
- "어디로 가요?" Options discussed
- Time considerations (점심 전? 후?)
- Casual relationship building
```

## 5. Pedagogical Goals

- Solidify location/existence concepts
- Make 어디 natural and automatic
- Reinforce particle usage in new contexts
- Expand time vocabulary naturally
- Maintain immersion while building complexity
- Show different work styles (theory vs. experiment)

## 6. Exercise Design Notes

- 맞아요/틀려요: Test location/existence comprehension
- 질문 대답: Mix "where" and "what" questions
- 빈칸: Focus on particles (에/에서) and 있다/없다 forms
- 연결: Match people with locations, times with activities

## 7. Story Consistency Checks

- Timeline: Morning arrival, flows to lunch discussion
- Ji-eun's expertise: Hardware/detector (different from Min-su's analysis)
- Room numbers: Keep track if specified
- Equipment locations: Should be consistent if mentioned again
- Character knowledge: Ji-eun knows detector stuff, Min-su knows analysis
