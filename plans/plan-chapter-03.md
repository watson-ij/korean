# Chapter 3 Plan

## Grammar Focus

### Main Grammar Point: Past Tense (았/었어요)
- **Primary pattern**: 았/었어요 (past tense polite)
- **Introduction strategy**: Through natural conversation about what happened earlier
- **Reinforcement**: Characters talking about what they did in the morning, what happened yesterday, what they ate
- **Variety**: Mix with present tense already learned to show contrast

### Secondary Grammar Elements
- Reinforce particles: 에서 (location of action), 을/를 (object)
- Continue time expressions: 어제 (yesterday), 아침 (morning)
- Question words in past context: 뭐 했어요? 어디 갔어요?

## Story Outline

### Setting
Late afternoon in the research lab (around 5-6 PM)

### Story Beats

1. **Opening**: Jun-ho arrives back at the research lab after being away (at 2nd floor). Min-su asks where he was and what he did.

2. **Conversation about the day**: Characters share what they did earlier
   - Jun-ho went to a meeting with the professor
   - Ji-eun tested the detector (solved the signal problem from Ch 2)
   - Ha-na read papers and practiced ROOT
   - Min-su worked on analysis code

3. **Lunch callback**: They talk about lunch - who ate what, where they went
   - References the Chapter 2 plan to go to student cafeteria
   - Some ate at cafeteria, someone went to convenience store

4. **Closing**: Evening routine - people preparing to leave or stay late
   - Natural setup for future chapters about work-life balance

### Characters
- Min-su (main POV)
- Jun-ho (just returned from meeting)
- Ji-eun (reports success with detector)
- Ha-na (learning, practicing)

### Story Arc Connection
- Continues daily lab life (Act 1: Collaboration Life)
- Builds character relationships and routines
- Shows typical graduate student schedule
- Ji-eun solves her detector problem from Chapter 2 (continuity)

## Vocabulary Plan

### New Vocabulary (8-10 words)

1. **어제** (yesterday)
   - Context: "어제도 늦게 왔어요" - talking about past days

   - Context: "어디 갔어요?" "학생식당에 갔어요"
   - Clear from movement/location context

3. **했어요** (did - past of 하다)
   - Context: "뭐 했어요?" "분석 했어요"
   - Clear from question-answer pattern

4. **먹었어요** (ate - past of 먹다)
   - Context: "점심 먹었어요?" "네, 먹었어요"
   - Clear from meal context

5. **만났어요** (met - past of 만나다)

   - Clear from time sequence: 아침 → 오전 → 점심 → 오후

7. **미팅** (meeting)

   - Clear from context of going somewhere official

8. **해결했어요** (solved - past of 해결하다)
   - Context: Ji-eun talking about fixing the detector problem
   - Already introduced 해결하다 in Ch 2, now past tense form

9. **늦게** (late, lately)
   - Context: "늦게 왔어요" vs "일찍 왔어요"
   - Clear from contrast with 일찍 (already known)

10. **집** (home, house)
    - Context: "집에 가요" "집에서 왔어요"
    - Clear from going/coming context

### Previously Introduced Vocabulary to Reinforce
- Time words: 오늘, 오전, 오후, 지금
- Location particles: 에, 에서
- Verbs (present forms): 가요, 와요, 있어요, 먹어요
- Question words: 뭐, 어디, 몇 시
- Characters and relationships: 교수님, 선배
- Lab vocabulary: 연구실, 분석, 검출기, 데이터

## Dialogue Situations

### 1. Asking about someone's day (past actions)
**Natural context**: Jun-ho returns, Min-su asks where he was
- "어디 갔어요?" "미팅 갔어요."
- "뭐 했어요?" "교수님을 만났어요."
- Creates natural past tense Q&A pattern

### 2. Talking about meals (completed actions)
**Natural context**: Discussing lunch that already happened
- "점심 먹었어요?" "네, 학생식당에서 먹었어요."
- "뭐 먹었어요?" "제육볶음 먹었어요."
- Connects to Chapter 2 (they planned to eat 제육볶음)

### 3. Reporting completed work
**Natural context**: Lab members sharing progress
- Ji-eun: "검출기 문제를 해결했어요!"
- Ha-na: "논문을 읽었어요."
- Min-su: "데이터 분석을 했어요."
- Professional conversation using past tense

### 4. Daily routine discussion
**Natural context**: Talking about when people arrived
- "언제 왔어요?" "아침에 왔어요." / "오후에 왔어요."
- "어제도 늦게 왔어요?"
- Time + past tense combination

## Teaching Strategy

### Contextual Introduction
- Start with obvious past action (Jun-ho returning from somewhere)
- Use visual/situational cues (empty desk → he wasn't here → where did he go?)
- Question-answer pairs reinforce pattern naturally

### Repetition Plan
- Each past tense verb appears 3-5 times minimum
- Mix of questions and statements
- Different subjects (나, 너, Jun-ho, 우리, etc.)

### Contrast with Present
- Show both: "지금 뭐 해요?" vs "아침에 뭐 했어요?"
- Helps learners see the tense distinction clearly

### Natural Flow
- Avoid forced teaching moments
- Past tense emerges from natural need to discuss completed actions
- Characters aren't explaining grammar, just having normal conversations about their day

## Exercise Design Notes

### 맞아요/틀려요
- Mix present and past tense to test comprehension
- Include some inference questions (did X happen before Y?)

### 질문에 대답하세요
- Focus on extracting past actions from text
- Where did X go? What did Y do? What did they eat?

### 빈칸 채우기
- Mix of particles and verb conjugations
- Past vs present tense discrimination
- Time markers (어제, 오늘, 아침에)

### 고르기/연결하기
- Match verbs with their past forms
- Connect time expressions with appropriate sentences
