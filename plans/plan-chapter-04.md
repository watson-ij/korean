# Plan for Chapter 4: 하나의 ROOT 수업

## 1. Grammar Focus

### Main Grammar Point: Future Tense (ㄹ 거예요, ㄹ까요)
- **ㄹ 거예요**: Stating future plans/predictions ("will do")
  - 민수가 ROOT를 가르칠 거예요. (Min-su will teach ROOT.)
  - 오늘 늦게까지 할 거예요. (We'll work until late today.)

- **ㄹ까요**: Suggesting/Wondering about future ("shall we?", "I wonder if...")
  - 뭘 먹을까요? (What shall we eat?)
  - 어려울까요? (Will it be difficult?)

### How It Will Be Introduced:
- Context: Ha-na's first ROOT tutorial session - naturally requires discussing what they will do
- Characters discussing plans for the tutorial and upcoming work
- Ha-na wondering about difficulty (어려울까요?)
- Building on ㄹ게요 from Chapter 3, but expanding to ㄹ 거예요 for more general future statements

### Reinforcement from Previous Chapters:
- Continue using past tense (했어요, 갔어요) for context
- Use present tense as base
- ㄹ게요 appears occasionally (already introduced)

## 2. Story Outline

### Setting:
- 연구실 (research lab), afternoon transitioning to evening
- One computer station where Min-su teaches Ha-na

### Main Story Beats:

1. **Tutorial Setup (14:00)**
   - Ha-na arrives for her scheduled ROOT tutorial with Min-su
   - Min-su explains what they will learn today
   - Ji-eun is working nearby, occasionally helps
   - Natural use of future tense: "오늘 뭐 배울 거예요?" "histogram을 그릴 거예요"

2. **Learning Session**
   - Min-su shows basic ROOT commands
   - Ha-na tries, makes small mistakes (relatable to reader)
   - They discuss what the next steps will be
   - "이제 뭘 할 거예요?" "데이터를 읽을 거예요"

3. **Break Time Conversation**
   - Brief coffee break
   - Discussion about evening plans
   - "오늘 저녁에 뭐 할 거예요?"
   - Jun-ho mentions he'll work late tonight on his analysis

4. **Continue & Future Plans**
   - Tutorial continues
   - Ha-na successfully creates her first histogram
   - Discussion about what Ha-na will practice tomorrow/next time
   - "내일 뭐 할 거예요?" "혼자 연습할 거예요"

### Characters:
- **김민수**: Main teacher, patient, explains clearly
- **최하나**: Eager student, asks questions, sometimes uncertain
- **이지은**: Working nearby, occasionally helps, encouraging
- **박준호**: Brief appearance, mentions his evening work plans

### How This Advances the Arc:
- Ha-na's growth as a researcher begins (Act 1 theme: collaboration life)
- Establishes the teaching/learning dynamic in the group
- Shows daily research work rhythm
- Sets up for future technical challenges
- Builds group camaraderie

## 3. Vocabulary Plan (7-10 new words)

### New Vocabulary with Context Clues:

1. **가르치다** (to teach)
   - Context: "민수가 ROOT를 가르칠 거예요" + Min-su physically showing/explaining
   - Reinforcement: contrasts with 배우다 (to learn)

2. **배우다** (to learn)
   - Context: "하나가 ROOT를 배울 거예요" + Ha-na's student role
   - Natural pair with 가르치다

3. **그리다** (to draw/plot) - reinforcement from Ch1, but now with ㄹ 거예요
   - Context: "histogram을 그릴 거예요" + computer screen showing plots

4. **읽다** (to read - data/files, different from 논문 읽다)
   - Context: "데이터를 읽을 거예요" + file loading on screen
   - Already know 읽다 from Ch2, but new context (data files vs papers)

5. **연습하다** (to practice)
   - Context: "내일 혼자 연습할 거예요" + discussion of Ha-na practicing alone
   - Clear from 혼자 (alone) + future action context

6. **어렵다** (difficult) - reinforcement from Ch3
   - Use in question form: "어려울까요?" (natural wondering)

7. **쉽다** (easy)
   - Context: paired contrast with 어렵다
   - "이건 쉬워요" when showing simple command

8. **처음** (first time)
   - Context: "처음 해 봐요" or "처음이에요?"
   - Clear from context of Ha-na's first tutorial

9. **다음** (next)
   - Context: "다음에 뭐 할 거예요?" (What will we do next time?)
   - Temporal sequence makes it clear

10. **천천히** (slowly)
    - Context: "천천히 해 보세요" when Ha-na is typing/working
    - Manner of action clear from context

### Previous Vocabulary to Reinforce:
- Time expressions: 오늘, 내일, 지금, 나중에
- Basic verbs in new tenses: 하다, 가다, 오다, 보다
- Computer/research terms: 컴퓨터, 데이터, 코드, ROOT, histogram
- Question words: 뭐, 어디, 언제, 어떻게

## 4. Dialogue Situations

### Situation 1: Planning the Tutorial
**Natural use of future tense to discuss plans**

Characters: Min-su and Ha-na
Context: Beginning of tutorial session, discussing what they'll learn

Naturally uses:
- ㄹ 거예요 for plans: "오늘 ROOT 기본을 배울 거예요"
- ㄹ까요 for suggestions: "어디서 시작할까요?"
- Question-answer patterns about future actions

### Situation 2: Wondering About Difficulty
**Natural use of ㄹ까요 for wondering/uncertainty**

Characters: Ha-na asking Min-su or Ji-eun
Context: Ha-na concerned about whether something will be difficult

Naturally uses:
- ㄹ까요 for wondering: "어려울까요?"
- Reassurance responses: "아니요, 쉬울 거예요"
- Contrast between 어렵다 and 쉽다

### Situation 3: Evening Plans Discussion
**Natural use of future tense for personal plans**

Characters: All four characters during break
Context: Casual conversation about after-work plans

Naturally uses:
- ㄹ 거예요 for stating plans: "저는 늦게까지 일할 거예요"
- ㄹ까요 for making suggestions: "같이 저녁 먹을까요?"
- Various time expressions with future tense

## 5. Technical Notes

### ROOT Commands to Show (for authenticity):
- Simple, visual commands that readers can follow conceptually
- `.x` to run macro
- `TH1F` for histogram (already mentioned in Ch1)
- `Draw()` command
- Keep it simple - focus on the interaction, not complex physics

### Story Consistency Checks:
- Timeline: Tutorial in afternoon (2pm), reasonable after lunch
- Ha-na's knowledge level: Appropriate for someone who's read papers but hasn't used ROOT
- Min-su's role: Established as helpful senior (from Ch1-3)
- Location: Same research lab, consistent room

### Pacing:
- ~600-700 words for main story
- Balance dialogue with action/description
- Show Ha-na's success at end (positive, encouraging)
- Future tense appears naturally ~12-15 times in various forms

## 6. Learning Objectives

By the end of Chapter 4, students should:

1. **Grammar**:
   - Understand and recognize ㄹ 거예요 for future plans
   - Understand ㄹ까요 for suggestions/wondering
   - Distinguish between ㄹ게요 (intention), ㄹ 거예요 (plan/prediction), ㄹ까요 (suggestion)

2. **Vocabulary**:
   - Teaching/learning vocabulary pair (가르치다/배우다)
   - Action verbs with future tense
   - Time expressions for future (내일, 다음에)

3. **Cultural**:
   - Senior-junior teaching dynamics in Korean labs
   - Collaborative learning culture
   - Research life: scheduled learning sessions

4. **Story**:
   - Ha-na's character development begins
   - Group dynamics continue to develop
   - Research work progression (not just meetings)

## 7. Exercise Design Notes

### 맞아요? 틀려요?
- Test comprehension of what will happen vs. what happened
- Mix present, past, and future events

### 질문에 대답하세요
- Questions using ㄹ 거예요: "하나는 내일 뭐 할 거예요?"
- Questions about plans and intentions

### 빈칸 채우기
- Practice future tense endings
- Mix with past tense for contrast
- Time expressions with appropriate tenses

### 고르기 (Multiple Choice)
- Choose correct future form
- Distinguish between ㄹ게요, ㄹ 거예요, ㄹ까요 in context

## 8. Connection to Chapter 5 Preview

Chapter 5 could introduce:
- **Want to (고 싶다)** - Ha-na wanting to learn more, characters discussing desires
- Or **Progressive (고 있다)** - showing ongoing work processes
- Continue future tense usage while adding new pattern
- Possible introduction of Michael? (if natural to story)
