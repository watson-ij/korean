## 2. BASIC VALIDATION CHECKS

### Dialogue Naturalness Check
**Score:** 8/10 ⚠️

**Strengths:**
- ✓ Good use of natural contractions and omissions
- ✓ Appropriate casual speech patterns for family/friends
- ✓ Natural question forms: "뭐 해?" (not 무엇을 해?)
- ✓ Subject omission where appropriate
- ✓ Natural phone conversation flow

**Issues Found:**

**CRITICAL (Unnatural):**
1. **Line 33:** "하나는 신입이야. 석사과정 1년차. 오늘 일찍 와."
   - ❌ Issue: "오늘 일찍 와" is unnatural tense usage
   - The context suggests she came early today (past), but "와" is present/future
   - **Should be:** "오늘 일찍 왔어" (past tense)
   - Natural pattern: When describing someone's action that already happened today, use past tense

2. **Line 73:** "음... 내일 오전에 다시 테스트해야겠어."
   - ⚠️ Minor: This self-talk is acceptable but slightly formal
   - More natural might be: "음... 내일 다시 해 봐야지" (more casual self-talk)
   - Not critical, but could be more colloquial

**MEDIUM (Acceptable but improvable):**
3. **Line 47:** "글쎄. 뉴스인가..."
   - ✓ Acceptable, but could add more natural filler
   - Alternative: "글쎄... 뉴스인가, 뭔가 그런 거" (more colloquial trailing off)

4. **Line 75:** "벌써 9시네요."
   - ⚠️ Issue: Who is she speaking to? This uses 존댓말 but she's alone
   - Should be: "벌써 9시네" (반말, talking to herself)
   - Or keep it as internal monologue without speech level marker

5. **Line 79:** "내일 봐요, 연구실."
   - ⚠️ Same issue: Using 존댓말 when alone
   - Should be: "내일 봐, 연구실" or just "내일 봐"
   - This is a farewell to an inanimate object, should be casual

### Back-Translation Test (Sample)
**Selected Sentences:**

1. "컴퓨터로 일해. 데이터를 봐." (Line 13)
   - Expected back-translation: Working on computer. Looking at data.
   - Pattern check: ✓ Natural instrumental particle usage

2. "신호가 이상해. 다시 봐야 해." (Line 17)
   - Expected: Signal is strange. Need to check again.
   - Pattern check: ✓ Natural causal connection

3. "민수? 누구야?" (Line 27)
   - Expected: Minsu? Who's that?
   - Pattern check: ✓ Very natural parent question

4. "오늘 일찍 와." (Line 33) ❌
   - Back-translation would likely be: "Comes early today."
   - This reveals the tense issue - should be past "왔어"

5. "아빠 뭐 해?" (Line 41)
   - Expected: What's dad doing?
   - Pattern check: ✓ Natural subject omission + casual question

**Result:** 4/5 sentences natural. One tense error detected.

### Collocation Verification ✓
**Status:** PASSED

All verb-object combinations are natural:
- 노트북을 봐요 ✓
- 데이터를 봐 ✓
- 밥은 먹어? ✓ (topic particle for checking)
- 텔레비전 봐 ✓
- 전화를 끝내요 ✓
- 문을 열어요 ✓
- 케이블을 찾아요 ✓
- 노트북을 닫아요 ✓
- 가방을 찾아요 ✓
- 불을 꺼요 ✓

## 3. ADDITIONAL CHECKS FOR COLLOQUIA

### Conversational Markers ✓
**Status:** GOOD

Natural use of:
- "응" (yes, casual) - appears 4 times
- "아" / "아, 그래" (acknowledgment)
- "글쎄" (well, I'm not sure)
- "잠시 후에" (in a moment)
- "그런데" (but, by the way)
- "음..." (thinking sound)

### Phone Conversation Realism ✓
**Status:** EXCELLENT

The phone conversation structure is very natural:
- Opening: "엄마, 안녕!" / "지은아, 안녕"
- Small talk progression: what doing → eating → work
- Natural interruption: "잠시 후에 다시 전화할게"
- Closing: parental concern + brief goodbye
- Describes ending call: "지은이 전화를 끝내요"

## 5. SUMMARY OF REQUIRED FIXES

### CRITICAL (Must Fix):
1. **Line 33:** Change "오늘 일찍 와" → "오늘 일찍 왔어"
2. **Line 75:** Change "벌써 9시네요" → "벌써 9시네"
3. **Line 79:** Change "내일 봐요, 연구실" → "내일 봐, 연구실"

### MEDIUM (Recommended):
4. **Line 73:** Consider changing "내일 오전에 다시 테스트해야겠어" → "내일 다시 해 봐야지" (more casual self-talk)

---

## 6. VALIDATION CONFIDENCE

**Overall Confidence:** HIGH (85%)

**Likely Natural Patterns:**
- Phone conversation structure matches real Korean family calls
- Particle usage is native-level
- Question forms are colloquial and natural
- Contractions and omissions are appropriate

**Flagged for Review:**
- Tense consistency in narrative past contexts
- Speech level in self-directed speech (talking to oneself/objects)

---

## 7. GOOGLE SEARCH ASSESSMENT

**Unlikely that Google search verification needed** for most phrases. The patterns are standard colloquial Korean.

However, if checking, these phrases would likely return many hits:
- "지금 뭐 해?" (10,000+ hits expected)
- "밥은 먹어?" (10,000+ hits expected)
- "너무 늦게까지 일하지 마" (1,000+ hits expected)

The flagged line "오늘 일찍 와" might return fewer hits because it's unnatural in this context.

## RECOMMENDATION

**Status:** NEEDS MINOR FIXES
**Action:** Apply 3 critical fixes, then re-validate quickly
**Estimated fix time:** 2 minutes
**Release readiness:** 95% (after fixes: 100%)

This colloquium is very well-written with natural conversational Korean. Only tense and speech level consistency issues need addressing.
