## Fixes Applied

### Fix Round 1: Critical Issues

#### 1. ✅ Past Tense Removal
**Changes made:**
- Line 61: "ROOT 괄호 문제 **해결했어**?" → "ROOT 괄호 문제 어때?"
- Line 63: "준호 선배가 **도와줬어요**" → "준호 선배가 **도와줘요**"
- Line 73: "준호 선배가 **추천했어요**" → "준호 선배 **추천**이에요"
- Line 75: "나도 읽었어" → "나도 읽어"

**Result:** All past tense verbs removed, grammar level now appropriate for Chapter 2

#### 2. ✅ Timeline Logic Fix
**Changes made:**
- Line 79: "벌써? 아직 일러. 12시에 먹자." → "아직 일러. 12시에 먹자."

**Result:** Removed contradiction, timeline now logically consistent

- Line 134: "케이블은 201호 방___ 있어요" → "지은은 3층 실험실___ 케이블을 찾아요"

**Result:** Exercise factually accurate, matches story content

#### 5. ✅ Bold Formatting Fix
**Changes made:**

- Timeline validation passed after fixes

**Vocabulary considerations:**
- Total new words: 27 (2 nouns added, 2 verbs removed, net 0 change)

- Technical terms clustered thematically (검출기, 센서, 신호)
- Recommendation: Consider spreading technical vocabulary across Ch2-4 in future revisions

**Natural speech patterns preserved:**
- Casual future "을 거야" retained as natural 반말 speech
- 반말/존댓말 distinction maintained
