## Issues Found in Round 2

### Critical Issues (Fixed)

#### 1. ✅ **Past Tense: "찾았어" (line 37-39)**
**Problem:** Line 39 contained past tense "찾았어" that slipped through initial validation
```korean
Original:
"찾았어?"
"응, 3층 실험실에서 찾았어."
```
**Fix Applied:**
```korean
Fixed:
"있어?"
"응, 3층 실험실에 있어."
```
**Impact:** Removed past tense, maintains Chapter 2 grammar level

#### 2. ✅ **Grammar Error: "에서" with "있다" (line 39)**
**Problem:** "3층 실험실에서 있어" uses incorrect particle
- "에서" is for action/activity locations
- "에" is for existence/static location with 있다

**Fix Applied:** Changed "에서" → "에"
```korean
"응, 3층 실험실에 있어."
```
**Impact:** Corrects fundamental particle usage, maintains pedagogical focus on 에 vs 에서

#### 3. ✅ **Future Tense: Multiple instances (lines 19, 31, 53, 67)**
**Problem:** Future tense "을/ㄹ 거야" used before Chapter 6-10 introduction
- Line 19: "2층에 있을 거야"
- Line 31: "3층 실험실에 있을 거야"
- Line 53: "오후에 다시 테스트할 거야"
- Line 67: "지금 뭐 할 거야?"

**Fix Applied:** Changed all to present tense
- "있을 거야" → "있어"
- "할 거야" → "해"

**Impact:** Strictly adheres to Chapter 2 grammar scope

#### 4. ✅ **Logical Contradiction: "몰라" + definite statement (line 19)**
**Problem:** After removing future tense, "몰라. 2층에 있어" became contradictory
- "몰라" = "I don't know"
- "있어" = "He is there" (definite)
- Future tense "있을 거야" (probably there) was expressing uncertainty

**Fix Applied:** Changed "몰라" → "글쎄"
```korean
Original: "몰라. 2층에 있을 거야."
Fixed: "글쎄. 2층에 있어."
```
**Impact:** "글쎄" (well, I'm not sure) maintains uncertainty without contradiction

#### 5. ✅ **Exercise Mismatch: Fill-in-blank #3 (line 133)**
**Problem:** Exercise used future tense "있을 거예요" but story now uses "있어"

**Fix Applied:**
```korean
Original: "준호는 2층___ 있을 거예요."
Fixed: "준호는 2층___ 있어요."
```
**Impact:** Exercise matches story grammar level

#### 6. ✅ **Exercise Mismatch: Fill-in-blank #4 (line 134)**
**Problem:** Exercise asked about "찾아요" but story changed from 찾다 to 있다

**Fix Applied:**
```korean
Original: "지은은 3층 실험실___ 케이블을 찾아요."
Fixed: "케이블은 3층 실험실___ 있어요."
```
**Impact:** Exercise accurately reflects story content

#### 7. ✅ **Vocabulary: Missing "글쎄"**
**Problem:** New word "글쎄" introduced but not in vocabulary list

**Fix Applied:**
- Added "글쎄 (well, I'm not sure)" to adverbs section
- Bolded "**글쎄**" on first appearance (line 19)

**Impact:** Complete vocabulary tracking

## Why Thorough Validation Was Necessary

The initial auto-fix round successfully addressed the most obvious issues (past tense in dialogue, exercise errors, vocabulary omissions), but missed several critical problems:

1. **Cascading effects:** Fixing one past tense verb (찾았어) required changing the entire dialogue structure
2. **Hidden past tense:** Line 37's question "찾았어?" was also past tense but wasn't flagged
3. **Future tense oversight:** First validation focused on past tense, didn't systematically check for future tense
4. **Particle grammar:** The change from "찾았어" to "있어" created a new particle error (에서 → 에)
5. **Logical coherence:** Removing future tense created a contradiction with "몰라" that required semantic adjustment
6. **Exercise synchronization:** Story changes required corresponding exercise updates

**Lesson:** Multi-pass validation catches cascading issues and ensures all parts of the chapter remain synchronized.

## Non-Critical Observations (For Future Reference)

### Still Present (Accepted):
1. **High vocabulary count (28 words):** Above recommended 10, but thematically clustered (time words, location words, lab vocabulary). Pedagogical decision to keep.

2. **Some short sentence sequences:** Opening paragraphs have several short sentences in a row. Creates staccato rhythm but may be appropriate for Chapter 2 simplicity.

3. **Line 15: "검출기 작업해":** Casual contraction of "검출기 작업을 해". Natural in 반말 but could be seen as teaching incorrect omission. However, this is authentic casual Korean.

4. **Line 63: "도와줘요" temporal ambiguity:** Present tense for past help action. Acceptable as Korean present tense can describe recent completed actions in casual speech ("helps me" → "has helped me" contextually).

5. **Line 75: "나도 읽어":** Ji-eun saying "I read [it] too" with present tense. Contextually suggests past action but present tense acceptable as habitual/general statement.

### Recommendations for Future Chapters:
1. Maintain tense discipline: Chapters 3-5 should continue present tense only
2. Consider reducing vocabulary load in Ch 3-4 to compensate for Ch 2's high count
3. Continue natural dialogue patterns - the 반말/존댓말 distinction is excellent
4. Plan exercises during writing phase to avoid synchronization issues
5. Consider multi-pass validation for all chapters to catch cascading effects
