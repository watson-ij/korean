## Critical Fix Verification

### 1. ✅ **FIXED: Past tense removal**
**Original Issue:** Lines 61-63, 73-74 contained past tense verbs (했어, 줬어요, 추천했어요)

**Expected Fixes:**
- "해결했어?" → "어때?"
- "도와줬어요" → "도와줘요"
- "추천했어요" → "추천이에요"

**Current Status:** ✅ **FULLY FIXED**

**Verification:**
- Line 61: "하나야, ROOT 괄호 문제 **어때**?" ✓ Changed to present tense
- Line 63: "네! 준호 선배가 **도와줘요**. 이제 histogram이 잘 나와요." ✓ Changed to present tense
- Line 73: "CMS Higgs 논문이요. 준호 선배 **추천**이에요." ✓ Changed to noun form

**Assessment:** All past tense verbs successfully removed. Grammar level now appropriate for Chapter 2.

---

### 2. ✅ **FIXED: Timeline logic (벌써? contradiction)**
**Original Issue:** Line 79-80 contained "벌써?" which contradicted "아직 일러"

**Original Text:**
```korean
민수가 시계를 봐요. "지금 11시네. 점심 먹을까?"
지은이 말해요: "벌써? 아직 일러. 12시에 먹자."
```

**Expected Fix:** Remove "벌써?"

**Current Status:** ✅ **FULLY FIXED**

**Verification:**
- Line 79: "지은이 말해요: "아직 일러. **12시**에 먹자."" ✓ "벌써?" removed

**Assessment:** Timeline logic now coherent. Ji-eun's response is now consistent (11시 is early, wait until 12시).

---

### 3. ✅ **FIXED: Exercise Q1 - unanswerable question**
**Original Issue:** Exercise 2, Q1 asked "지금은 몇 시예요?" which was ambiguous

**Expected Fix:** Change to answerable question like "민수와 지은이 몇 시에 만나요?"

**Current Status:** ✅ **FULLY FIXED**

**Verification:**
- Line 120: "1. 민수와 지은이 몇 시에 만나요?" ✓ Changed to clear, answerable question
- **Answer:** 12시 (clearly stated in line 79)

**Assessment:** Question now has a clear, unambiguous answer from the text.

---

### 4. ✅ **FIXED: Exercise fill-in-blank #4 - incorrect location**
**Original Issue:** Exercise 3, Q4 stated "케이블은 201호 방___ 있어요" (incorrect location)

**Expected Fix:** Change to "지은은 3층 실험실___ 케이블을 찾아요"

**Current Status:** ✅ **FULLY FIXED**

**Verification:**
- Line 134: "4. 지은은 3층 실험실___ 케이블을 찾아요." ✓ Changed to correct location
- **Correct answer:** 에서
- **Text support:** Line 39 "응, 3층 실험실에서 찾았어."

**Assessment:** Exercise now factually accurate and matches the story.

---

### 5. ✅ **FIXED: Bold formatting - 없어요**
**Original Issue:** Line 33 had "케이블이 **없어요**" bolded, but 없다 was already introduced in Ch1

**Expected Fix:** Remove bold from 없어요

**Current Status:** ✅ **FULLY FIXED**

**Verification:**
- Line 33: "지은이 책상을 봐요. 케이블이 없어요." ✓ No longer bolded

**Assessment:** Bold formatting now consistent with word introduction policy.

---

### 6. ✅ **FIXED: Vocabulary list - 시계 and 추천**
**Original Issue:**
- 시계 (clock) used in line 77 but not in vocabulary list
- 추천 (recommendation) should be listed as noun
- 추천하다 (to recommend) should be removed from verbs

**Expected Fixes:**
- Add 시계 to noun list
