# Chapter 2 Validation Report
## 제2과: 지은이 와요

**Validation Date:** 2025-10-14
**Validated By:** Claude Code
**Overall Assessment:** Good quality with some issues that need attention

---

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### 1. **Grammar: Past tense usage too early**
**Location:** Lines 61-63, 73-74
**Issue:** Chapter 2 uses past tense (했어, 줬어요, 추천했어요) before it's introduced in the grammar progression.
```korean
Line 61: "ROOT 괄호 문제 **해결했어**?"
Line 63: "네! 준호 선배가 **도와줬어요**. 이제 histogram이 잘 나와요."
Line 73: "CMS Higgs 논문이요. 준호 선배가 **추천했어요**."
```
**Reason:** According to the grammar progression plan, past tense (았/었어요) is introduced in Chapters 6-10, not Chapter 2.
**Recommendation:** Rephrase using present tense or present perfect patterns available in Ch1-2:
- "ROOT 괄호 문제 해결해?" → "ROOT 괄호 문제 어때?"
- "준호 선배가 도와줘요" (present)
- "준호 선배가 추천해요" or just "준호 선배 추천이에요"

### 2. **Story inconsistency: Timeline confusion**
**Location:** Lines 77-80
**Issue:** Logic problem with the time discussion
```korean
민수가 시계를 봐요. "지금 **11시**네. 점심 먹을까?"
지은이 말해요: "벌써? 아직 일러. **12시**에 먹자."
```
**Problem:** If it's 11:00, saying "벌써?" (already?) makes less sense. Saying "아직 일러" (still early) is correct, but "벌써?" contradicts this.
**Recommendation:** Change to:
- "11시네. 점심 먹을까?" → 지은: "아직 일러. 12시에 먹자."
- OR "11시 반이네. 점심 먹을까?" → 지은: "좋아, 조금 있다가."

### 3. **Exercise error: Question 1 answer ambiguity**
**Location:** Line 120 (Exercise section)
**Issue:** "지금은 몇 시예요?" cannot be answered from the text.
**Problem:** The text says "지금 11시네" but 지금 at that moment could refer to the story's internal time, not the reader's understanding. Also, by the end it's described as later (before 12:00).
**Recommendation:** Change to: "민수가 시계를 볼 때 몇 시예요?" or "민수와 지은이 몇 시에 만나요?" (which has a clear answer: 12시)

---

## High Priority Issues (Should Fix)

### 4. **Vocabulary: Too many new nouns**
**Location:** Throughout chapter
**Issue:** Chapter introduces more than the recommended 7-10 new words. Count from 새 단어 정리:
- **Nouns:** 15 items (지금, 오전, 오후, 층, 호, 방, 검출기, 실리콘, 파이썬, 케이블, 신호, 센서, 수업, 인터넷, 제육볶음)
- **Verbs:** 6 items (찾다, 필요하다, 돌아오다, 해결하다, 도와주다, 추천하다)
- **Adjectives:** 1 item (낮다)
- **Adverbs:** 2 items (어디, 같이)
- **Total:** 24 new words

**Recommendation:** This is too many for Chapter 2. Some words from the vocabulary tracker appear in the story but aren't new introductions from context:
- **Already contextually present:** 시계, 문, 가방, 책상, 실험실, 테스트, 소리 (from Ch1 context)
- **Can be removed from story:** Consider reducing technical terms or spreading them across chapters

### 5. **Bold formatting: Inconsistent with first appearance**
**Location:** Multiple places
**Issue:** Some words appear unbolded before being bolded:
- Line 7: "지은이 **들어와요**" - but 들어오다 was introduced in Ch1 (line 27, 하나가 들어와요)
- Line 33: "케이블이 **없어요**" - 없다 was used in Ch1
- Line 35: "잠시 후 지은이 **돌아와요**" - The word after 잠시 후 is similar to 들어와요 pattern

**Recommendation:**
- Don't bold 들어와요 (already known)
- Don't bold 없어요 (already known)
- Keep bolding 돌아와요 (new variation)

### 6. **Grammar: Future tense appears too casually**
**Location:** Lines 19, 31, 53
**Issue:** "을 거야" is used multiple times as casual future
```korean
Line 19: "201호 방에 **있을 거야**"
Line 31: "3층 실험실에 **있을 거야**"
Line 53: "오후에 다시 테스트**할 거야**"
```
**Assessment:** This isn't necessarily wrong - the grammar progression shows future (ㄹ 거예요) in Chapters 6-10, but casual future (거야) appears here.
**Recommendation:** Either:
1. Keep it as natural speech (since 민수/지은 use 반말)
2. OR change to present probability: "201호 방에 있어" or use question form: "201호 방에 있을까?"

### 7. **Exercise consistency: Question numbering**
**Location:** Exercise section 2, Line 134
**Issue:** Fill-in-the-blank #4 has an error
```
4. 케이블은 201호 방___ 있어요.
```
**Problem:** The text says the cable is NOT in 201호 - it says Jun-ho is in 201호 (line 19), and the cable is found in the 3층 실험실 (line 39).
**Recommendation:** Change to: "지은은 3층 실험실___ 케이블을 찾았어요."

---

## Medium Priority Issues (Nice to Fix)

### 8. **Naturalness: Repetitive sentence structure**
**Location:** Lines 5-11
**Issue:** Too many short sentences with similar structure (Subject + Verb)
```korean
민수는 연구실에 있어요. 컴퓨터 앞에 앉아요. 데이터 분석을 해요.
누가 문을 열어요. 지은이 들어와요. 지은은 대학원생이에요.
```
**Recommendation:** Vary sentence structure:
- "민수는 연구실에 있어요. 컴퓨터 앞에 앉아서 데이터 분석을 해요."
- "누가 문을 열어요. 지은이에요. 지은은 대학원생이에요 - 박사과정 2년차예요."

### 9. **Dialogue formality: Inconsistent register**
**Location:** Lines 67-73
**Issue:** Ji-eun speaks informally to Ha-na but Ha-na uses formal speech
```korean
지은이 물어봐요: "하나야, 지금 뭐 할 거야?" [informal]
"분석 공부해요. 그리고 논문을 읽어요." [formal]
```
**Assessment:** This is actually correct (Ha-na is junior) but could be more consistent in what Ji-eun/Min-su use.
**Note:** Line 67 - Ji-eun drops to 반말 suddenly, whereas earlier (line 57) she said "오늘 일찍 왔네?" which is more casual but not full 반말.

### 10. **Context clarity: USB Cable specificity**
**Location:** Line 29
**Issue:** "USB 케이블" is specified in dialogue but this adds vocabulary without clear visual context
```korean
"USB 케이블. 검출기 테스트에 필요해."
```
**Recommendation:** Either:
1. Keep "USB" as it's a common loan word
2. OR just use "케이블" since the type isn't crucial to the story

### 11. **Cultural consistency: Time expectations**
**Location:** Lines 77-80
**Issue:** 11:00 for lunch in a Korean research context
**Note:** Korean lunch is typically 12:00-1:00, so 11:00 is indeed early. The dialogue reflects this ("아직 일러"), so this is actually fine. Just noting it for context.

### 12. **Character knowledge: Ha-na's capability**
**Location:** Lines 61-64
**Issue:** Ha-na has already solved her ROOT problem from Chapter 1
**Assessment:** This is good story continuity (Jun-ho helped her), but it happens off-screen between chapters.
**Recommendation:** This is actually well-handled. No change needed, but noting it shows good character progression.

---

## Low Priority Suggestions

### 13. **Vocabulary choice: 시계 not in 새 단어 정리**
**Location:** Line 77
**Issue:** "민수가 시계를 봐요" introduces 시계 (clock/watch) but it's not listed in the new vocabulary section.
**Note:** The vocabulary tracker includes it but the chapter's 새 단어 정리 doesn't.
**Recommendation:** Add 시계 to the noun list or remove the sentence (민수 could just notice the time without explicitly looking at a clock).

### 14. **Vocabulary order: Temporal words cluster**
**Location:** Throughout
**Observation:** Chapter introduces many time/location words together:
- Time: 지금, 오전, 오후, 11시, 12시
- Location: 층, 호, 방, 어디

**Assessment:** This is actually pedagogically sound - grouping related concepts.
**Recommendation:** No change needed.

### 15. **Technical vocabulary density**
**Location:** Lines 15, 45-49
**Issue:** Several technical terms in quick succession
```korean
Line 15: "나는 검출기 작업해. 실리콘 검출기."
Lines 45-49: "검출기 데이터... 신호... 실리콘 센서 신호"
```
**Assessment:** For a science-focused textbook, this is appropriate, but it's dense.
**Recommendation:** Consider whether all three terms (검출기, 센서, 신호) need to appear in Chapter 2, or if some could wait until Chapter 3-4 when the student is more comfortable.

### 16. **Exercise variety: Fill-in-blanks focus heavily on particles**
**Location:** Exercise 3 (Lines 129-140)
**Observation:** 7 out of 10 fill-in-blanks are particles (에, 에서, 이, 은, 과)
**Assessment:** This is good practice for particle distinction (especially 에 vs 에서), which is the chapter focus.
**Recommendation:** This is appropriate for Chapter 2. Well designed.

### 17. **Story pacing: Quick scene changes**
**Location:** Lines 33-40
**Issue:** Ji-eun leaves and returns in just two lines
```korean
Line 33: "여기 없네. 3층에 가 볼게."
Line 35: 잠시 후 지은이 돌아와요.
```
**Assessment:** The pacing is fast but acceptable for a short learning chapter.
**Recommendation:** Could add one sentence of Min-su continuing work while Ji-eun is gone, but not critical.

### 18. **Vocabulary: 같이 vs 함께**
**Location:** Line 93
**Note:** Uses 같이 (together) in "우리랑 먹자"
**Assessment:** 같이 is more colloquial than 함께. For this informal register, it's appropriate.
**Recommendation:** No change needed.

### 19. **Context clue: 제육볶음**
**Location:** Line 85
**Issue:** "제육볶음" is introduced as today's cafeteria menu with no visual or context clues
**Assessment:** This is a very specific Korean dish. Students would need to either:
1. Recognize it as a Korean food name pattern
2. Infer from Ji-eun's excited reaction ("오, 좋아!")
**Recommendation:** This is borderline acceptable. The positive reaction gives context that it's something good. Consider adding a brief descriptor in a future supplementary material.

### 20. **Consistency: Ha-na's agency**
**Location:** Lines 84-95
**Observation:** Ha-na contributes useful information (checking the menu online), then is invited to join lunch
**Assessment:** This is good character development - Ha-na is becoming more integrated into the group.
**Recommendation:** No change needed. This is well-handled.

## Grammar Level Analysis

### Appropriate for Chapter 2:
✓ Present tense (아/어요) - extensively used
✓ Basic particles (은/는, 이/가, 을/를, 에, 에서) - well practiced
✓ Existence (있다/없다) - multiple contexts
✓ Basic questions (뭐, 어디) - natural use
✓ Numbers and time - introduced appropriately

### Too advanced for Chapter 2:
✗ Past tense (했어, 줬어요, 추천했어요) - should be Ch 6-10
✗ Future casual (할 거야) - borderline, might be acceptable as natural speech

### Grammar patterns reinforced from Chapter 1:
✓ Topic/subject particles
✓ Location particles (에, 에서) - good distinction shown
✓ Casual vocative (야)
✓ Present tense verbs

---

## Vocabulary Analysis

### New Word Count: ~24 words (HIGH)
**Recommended maximum: 10 words**

**Core essential words (keep):**
1. 지금 (now) - temporal
2. 오전/오후 (AM/PM) - temporal pair
3. 어디 (where) - question word
4. 찾다 (to find) - useful verb
5. 필요하다 (to need) - useful verb
6. 같이 (together) - social
7. 수업 (class) - student context

**Technical terms (consider reducing):**
- 검출기 (detector)
- 실리콘 (silicon)
- 센서 (sensor)
- 신호 (signal)

**Recommendation:** Spread technical terms across Ch2-3-4, introducing 2-3 per chapter rather than 4 in Ch2.

**Location words (good thematic cluster):**
- 층 (floor)
- 호 (room number)
- 방 (room)

**Vocabulary from tracker not in 새 단어 정리:**
- 시계, 문, 가방, 책상, 실험실, 테스트, 소리

**Recommendation:** Either add these to the vocabulary list OR ensure they're deducible from Chapter 1 context (most are).

## Story Consistency Check

### Timeline:
✓ 화요일 오전 (Tuesday morning) - follows 월요일 (Monday) from Ch1
✓ 11시 discussion → 12시 lunch plan - logical
⚠ "벌써?" at 11:00 for lunch - slightly awkward (see Critical Issue #2)

### Character Locations:
✓ Min-su: 연구실 (lab)
✓ Ji-eun: arrives at lab, goes to 3층 실험실, returns
✓ Jun-ho: mentioned as being on 2층 201호 (not physically present)
✓ Ha-na: arrives at lab
✓ All three plan to meet at 1층 at 12:00 - logical

### Character Knowledge:
✓ Ha-na is still learning (doesn't know much yet)
✓ Ha-na's ROOT problem was solved by Jun-ho (off-screen) - good continuity
✓ Min-su does data analysis (consistent with Ch1)
✓ Ji-eun works on detector hardware (new information, appropriate)
✓ Jun-ho mentioned but not present (he's working elsewhere) - realistic

### Character Relationships:
✓ Min-su/Ji-eun use 반말 to each other - peer relationship
✓ Ha-na uses 존댓말 to 선배들 - junior relationship
✓ Min-su/Ji-eun call Ha-na with "하나야" - casual but senior

✓ Generally natural for lab setting
✓ Appropriate code-switching (Korean + technical English terms)
✓ Realistic small talk about food
⚠ Some choppiness in early narration (see Medium Priority Issue #8)

### Formality Levels:
✓ Min-su/Ji-eun 반말 - appropriate peer speech
✓ Ha-na 존댓말 - appropriate junior speech

## Recommendations Summary

### Must fix before publishing:
1. Remove past tense verbs (해결했어, 도와줬어요, 추천했어요) - replace with present tense
2. Fix timeline logic: 11시 + "벌써?" contradiction
3. Fix Exercise 2, Q1: rephrase to be answerable
4. Fix Exercise 3, Q4: cable location error

### Should fix for better quality:
5. Reduce total new vocabulary from 24 to ~10-12 core words
6. Remove bold from already-known words (들어와요, 없어요)
7. Consider adjusting casual future (거야) or keep as natural speech
8. Verify 시계 in vocabulary list

### Nice to have improvements:
9. Vary sentence structure in opening paragraphs
10. Spread technical vocabulary across multiple chapters
11. Minor pacing adjustments
