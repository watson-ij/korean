## Fixes Applied

### Fix Iteration 1 (All issues resolved)

**Fix 1: 준호-하나 Mixed Formality (MEDIUM → RESOLVED)**

Location: Lines 31, 35

Changes:
```diff
Line 31:
- "하나야, 오늘 뭐 **했어요**?"
+ "하나야, 오늘 뭐 **했어**?"

Line 35:
- "오, 좋네! 다 읽었어요?"
+ "오, 좋네! 다 읽었어?"
```

Rationale: Senior (준호) to junior (하나) should use consistent casual speech. Casual vocative (하나야) with casual question form (했어?) is natural Korean.

**Fix 2: 민수-지은 Peer Inconsistency (HIGH → RESOLVED)**

Location: Lines 65, 69

Changes:
```diff
Line 65:
- "어제요? 음... 11시에 갔어요. Zoom 미팅이 있었어요."
+ "어제? 음... 11시에 갔어. Zoom 미팅이 있었어."

Line 69:
- "네. 그래서 오늘 아침에 늦게 **일어났어요**."
+ "네. 그래서 오늘 아침에 늦게 **일어났어**."
```

Rationale: 민수 (PhD 3rd year) and 지은 (PhD 2nd year) are close peers in the same lab. Consistent casual speech between peers is natural and expected. This matches their existing interaction at line 47 where 민수 uses "지은아, 어떻게 해결했어?" (casual).

## Special Notes - Chapter Type

**Chapter-Specific Observations:**

1. **Grammar Introduction**: Past tense (았/었어요) introduced excellently with 10+ varied verbs in natural contexts

2. **Story Consistency**: Perfect timeline and location tracking. All character movements logical. Facts consistent with previous chapters.

3. **Character Knowledge**: Each character uses vocabulary/concepts appropriate to their level:
   - 하나 (Master's 1st year): Basic, finds advanced concepts difficult
   - 민수/지은 (PhD 2nd/3rd year): Competent with analysis and hardware
   - 준호 (PhD 5th year): Senior, reviewing others' work

4. **Technical Vocabulary**: Natural integration of particle physics terms without forced teaching (CMS, Higgs, histogram, 검출기, 케이블, etc.)

5. **Speech Level Variety**: Now demonstrates three relationship types clearly:
   - Peer (민수↔지은): Casual both ways
   - Senior-junior (준호→하나/민수/지은): Casual from senior, polite from junior
   - Group settings: Appropriate mixed levels
