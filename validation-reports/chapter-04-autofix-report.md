   - After: `지은은 책상에서 코드를 봐요. 민수와 하나의 이야기를 들어요.`
   - **Impact:** Simplified sentence structure using only introduced patterns

2. **Line 25:** Simplified explanation
   - Before: `"자, 먼저 ROOT를 열 거예요. 그리고 데이터를 읽을 거예요."`
   - After: `"자, 먼저 ROOT를 열 거예요. 데이터를 읽을 거예요."`
   - **Impact:** Removed connector word, maintained clarity

3. **Line 71 (CRITICAL):** Removed ~고 connector pattern
   - Before: `준호가 문을 열고 들어와요. 커피를 들고 있어요.`

   - **Impact:** Used 먼저 (already introduced) instead of 그런데

### Verification of Future Tense Focus (✓ MAINTAINED)

**Results:**
- ㄹ 거예요/거야: 23 instances in story ✓

## Remaining Issues (Require Broader Curriculum Changes)

### Vocabulary Violations (50+ words)

**Category 1: Basic Conversational Words (Should be Chapter 1)**
- **안녕, 네, 응, 아니, 자** - These are fundamental Korean conversation basics
- **Recommendation:** Add to Chapter 1 vocabulary tracker

**Category 2: Essential Computer/Technical Terms**
- **키보드** (keyboard), **화면** (screen), **버튼** (button)
- **Analysis:** These are unavoidable for a story about learning computer software
- **Recommendation:** Either:
  a) Add to Chapter 2 (computer vocabulary chapter), or
  b) Bold and introduce in Chapter 4 with context clues

**Category 3: Essential Verbs for Computer Tutorial**
- **듣다** (to listen), **치다** (to type), **나오다** (to come out/appear)
- **끝내다** (to finish), **잘하다** (to do well)
- **Analysis:** Critical for describing tutorial activities
- **Recommendation:** Add to earlier chapters or accept as context-learnable

**Category 4: Basic Connectors**
- **그래서** (so/therefore), **그런데** (but/however), **그리고** (and)
- **Analysis:** These are fundamental discourse markers
- **Recommendation:** Add to Chapter 2 or 3

**Category 5: Numbers and Time**
- **2시, 4시 반, 6시쯤** - time expressions with new numbers
- **세** (three), **명** (counter for people)
- **Analysis:** Numbers system not yet introduced systematically
- **Recommendation:** Either introduce number system earlier or limit time expressions

**Category 6: Personal Pronouns**
- **제/제가** (humble I), **나** (informal I), **너/너희** (you), **우리** (we)
- **Analysis:** Essential for natural dialogue
- **Recommendation:** Introduce pronoun system in Chapter 2 or 3

**Category 7: Essential Particles**
- **의** (possessive), **와/과** (and), **까지** (until)
- **Analysis:** Basic particles needed for natural speech
- **Recommendation:** Add to Chapter 1 or 2 particle introduction

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✓ **Use chapter-04-fixed.md** - Grammar issues resolved
2. **Update vocabulary tracker** to reflect actual introduced words in Chapters 1-3
3. **Review Chapters 1-3** to add missing foundational vocabulary:
   - Basic greetings and responses (안녕, 네, 응)
   - Personal pronouns (나, 제, 우리, 너희)
   - Essential connectors (그래서, 그런데, 그리고)
   - Basic particles (의, 와, 까지)

### Curriculum-Wide Actions:
1. **Establish number system** - Introduce 1-10 and time telling systematically in Chapter 2 or 3
2. **Introduce computer vocabulary** - Add 키보드, 화면, 버튼 to Chapter 2 (research lab setting)
3. **Add essential verbs** - Include 듣다, 치다, 나오다 in appropriate early chapters
4. **Systematize pronouns** - Create clear pronoun introduction in Chapter 2 or 3
5. **Expand particle coverage** - Ensure 의, 와, 까지 are introduced by Chapter 2

### Alternative Approach:
Accept that some very basic words (안녕, 네, 키보드) are so fundamental or context-obvious that they don't require formal introduction, and update the teaching philosophy accordingly.
