Exercises are well-designed and appropriately challenging.

**Overall Score: 9.2/10**

---

## 1. Korean Language Quality ✅ **EXCELLENT**

### Dialogue Naturalness: 9.5/10

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Authentic university lab conversation style
- ✅ Natural code-review dialogue: "괜찮아. 어디 보자. 아, 여기! 괄호가 없어. 다시 해 봐."
- ✅ Realistic student-teacher dynamic
- ✅ Natural teasing between colleagues: "또 배고파? 점심 먹은 지 얼마 안 됐잖아."
- ✅ Appropriate use of fillers and natural expressions: "어려울까 했는데," "거의 끝나 가"

**Examples of Excellent Naturalness:**
```korean
Line 7: "하나야, 안녕! 준비됐어?"
→ Perfect friendly senior-to-junior greeting

Line 35: "괜찮아. 어디 보자. 아, 여기! 괄호가 없어. 다시 해 봐."
→ Exactly how Korean speakers debug code

Line 47: "네! 어려울까 했는데 괜찮아요."
→ Natural expression of pleasant surprise

Line 89: "우리는 조금 있다가 먹을까? 하나 수업이 거의 끝나 가."
→ Natural colloquial ending "끝나 가"
```

**Minor Issue Found:**
- **Line 71**: "준호가 문을 열어요. 연구실에 들어와요. 커피를 들어요."
  - **Problem**: "커피를 들어요" (he lifts/holds coffee) sounds slightly unnatural as a standalone narration sentence. The verb 들다 describes the action of lifting/holding, but in context, we want to convey that he's entering with coffee.
  - **Cause**: This was simplified from "커피를 들고 들어와요" (entering while holding) to avoid using ~고 connector (not yet introduced).
  - **Impact**: Minor - grammatically correct but slightly awkward phrasing
  - **Suggested fix**: "커피가 있어요" (He has coffee) - more natural and uses introduced pattern
  - **Alternative**: Keep as is if acceptable - the meaning is clear from context

### Speech Level Consistency: 10/10 ✅

Perfect speech level management throughout:

| Speaker → Listener | Speech Level | Examples | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ha-na → Min-su | 해요체 (polite) | "오늘 뭐 배울 거예요?" | ✓ Appropriate |
| Min-su → Ha-na | 해요체 + 반말 mix | "이제 하나가 해 봐. 천천히 해." | ✓ Natural teaching style |
| Peers (민수↔지은↔준호) | 반말 (casual) | "나는 6시에 갈게. 너희 먼저 가." | ✓ Natural friends |
| Ha-na → Ji-eun/Jun-ho | 해요체 (polite) | "재미있어요! histogram을 그렸어요." | ✓ Junior to seniors |
| Narration | Consistent 해요체 | Throughout | ✓ Appropriate |

**No mixing errors detected!**

### Particle Usage: 10/10 ✅

All particles are used correctly throughout the chapter:

```korean
✓ Line 5: "ROOT를 가르칠 거예요" (object marker)
✓ Line 17: "민수 옆에 앉아요" (location marker)
✓ Line 17: "민수의 컴퓨터를 봐요" (possessive + object)
✓ Line 23: "민수와 하나의 이야기를 들어요" (conjunction + possessive)
✓ Line 31: "키보드 앞에 앉아요" (location marker)
✓ Line 81: "오늘 저녁에 뭐 할 거예요?" (time marker)
✓ Line 135: "점심 먹은 지 얼마 안 됐잖아" (advanced 지 pattern)
```

**No particle errors found!**

### Natural Contractions & Expressions: 9/10 ✅

Good use of natural spoken forms:
- ✓ "어려울까 했는데" (natural contraction)
- ✓ "거의 끝나 가" (colloquial progressive)
- ✓ "너희는?" (natural abbreviated question)
- ✓ "먹은 지 얼마 안 됐잖아" (natural time expression)

## 5. Vocabulary List (새 단어 정리)

### Accuracy: 9/10 ✅

**Correctly Listed:**
- ✓ 가르치다, 배우다, 그리다, 읽다, 연습하다 (verbs)
- ✓ 쉽다 (adjective)
- ✓ 처음, 다음, 천천히, 열심히 (adverbs/other)
- ✓ Grammar patterns (ㄹ 거예요, ㄹ까요, 겠습니다)

**Minor Omission:**
- **어렵다** (difficult) - appears in lines 13 and 47 (contrasted with 쉽다) but not listed in 새 단어 정리
  - **Note**: 어렵다 was in Chapter 1 vocabulary, so this is reinforcement, not new introduction
  - **Recommendation**: Either add to 새 단어 정리 as "(reinforcement)" or add a note in the plan that it's being reinforced

**Assessment:** Vocabulary list is accurate for new words. Minor note needed about reinforced vocabulary.

## Summary of Issues

### ⚠️ MINOR ISSUE (Optional Fix)

**Line 71: Slightly Unnatural Phrasing**

**Current text:**
```korean
준호가 문을 열어요. 연구실에 들어와요. 커피를 들어요.
```

**Issue:** "커피를 들어요" (he holds/lifts coffee) sounds slightly awkward as standalone narration. The verb 들다 describes an action of lifting/holding, but we want to convey that he's entering with coffee.

**Why it's like this:** Simplified from "커피를 들고 들어와요" to avoid using ~고 connector (not yet introduced).

**Suggested revision:**
```korean
준호가 문을 열어요. 연구실에 들어와요. 커피가 있어요.
```
Or:
```korean
준호가 문을 열어요. 연구실에 들어와요. 커피 한 잔이 있어요.
```

**Rationale:** "커피가 있어요" (he has coffee) is more natural and uses patterns already introduced (있다 existence/possession).

**Impact if not fixed:** Very minor - meaning is clear from context, just slightly less idiomatic.

### 📝 MINOR NOTE

**Vocabulary List:**
- Consider adding note that 어렵다 (lines 13, 47) is reinforcement from Chapter 1, not new vocabulary

---

## Recommendation

**STATUS: ✅ READY TO USE**

This chapter is **publication-ready** and can be used as-is. The single minor phrasing issue (line 71) is **optional to fix** - the meaning is clear from context and the grammar is correct.

### If you want to apply the optional fix:

The revised sentence would be:
```korean
Line 71: 준호가 문을 열어요. 연구실에 들어와요. 커피가 있어요.
```

### If you proceed as-is:

The chapter is completely functional and students will understand the story. The "커피를 들어요" phrasing, while slightly less natural, is grammatically correct and contextually clear.

---

## Conclusion

**Chapter 4 is excellent work!** It successfully introduces future tense through an engaging, realistic tutorial scenario. The dialogue is natural, exercises are well-designed, and the story advances Ha-na's character arc meaningfully. With 29 instances of the target grammar pattern and perfect contextual vocabulary introduction, this chapter exemplifies the natural method approach.

**Congratulations on creating high-quality, engaging Korean learning materials!**
