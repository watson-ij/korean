# Auto-Fix Report: colloquium-02.md
**Type:** Colloquium (Casual Dialogue Supplement)
**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** ✅ READY

---

## Initial Issues Found
- **3 critical** issues (tense consistency, speech level in self-talk)
- **0 high** issues
- **1 medium** issue (suggested improvement, not applied)

---

## Changes Made

### Fix 1: Past Tense Correction (Line 33)
**Before:** "오늘 일찍 와. 수업이 없어."
**After:** "오늘 일찍 왔어. 수업이 없어."
**Reason:** When describing an action that already happened today, Korean uses past tense. "와" (present/future) was unnatural here.

### Fix 2: Self-Talk Speech Level (Line 75)
**Before:** "벌써 9시네요."
**After:** "벌써 9시네."
**Reason:** Ji-eun is talking to herself. Using 존댓말 (네요) when alone is unnatural. Changed to casual 반말 (네).

### Fix 3: Self-Talk Speech Level (Line 79)
**Before:** "내일 봐요, 연구실."
**After:** "내일 봐, 연구실."
**Reason:** When saying goodbye to an inanimate object (the lab) while alone, casual speech is more natural than formal.

### Preserved Strengths:

✅ Subject omission where appropriate

- **Family relationship speech:** Authentic mother-daughter casual tone
- **Friend interaction:** Natural peer dialogue with Min-su

## Special Notes

### Why These Errors Occurred:
The original version had:
1. Inconsistent tense in reported speech context
2. Over-formal self-directed speech (possibly influenced by the narrative's 존댓말 framing)

These are subtle errors that don't affect comprehension but reduce naturalness for native speakers.

### What Makes It Natural Now:
- Past tense "왔어" clearly indicates Ha-na already arrived earlier today
- Self-talk "9시네" and "내일 봐" sound like natural internal monologue
- Consistent speech levels throughout all dialogue types

## Comparison: Before vs After Fix

**Dialogue section (Line 33):**
```
Before: "하나는 신입이야. 석사과정 1년차. 오늘 일찍 와. 수업이 없어."
After:  "하나는 신입이야. 석사과정 1년차. 오늘 일찍 왔어. 수업이 없어."
         [More natural past tense for completed action]
```

**Monologue sections (Lines 75, 79):**
```
Before: 벌써 9시네요. ... "내일 봐요, 연구실."
After:  벌써 9시네. ... "내일 봐, 연구실."
         [Consistent casual self-talk]
```

## Recommendation

**This colloquium is now ready for learners.** The fixes were minor but important for naturalness. The dialogue captures authentic Korean family and peer interactions, making it an excellent casual practice supplement to Chapter 2.

### For Future Colloquia:
- Watch for tense consistency in reported/embedded speech
- Remember: self-talk and talking to objects should be 반말
- Narrative framing (지은이 노트북을 봐요) can stay formal while quoted speech is casual
