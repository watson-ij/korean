## 2. BASIC VALIDATION

### Dialogue Naturalness Check (Score: 9/10)

**Contractions and natural forms:**
- Line 21: "아, 그래." ✓ (natural short response)
- Line 33: "여기 없네. 3층에 가 볼게." ✓ (natural with 네, 볼게)
- Line 77: "지금 11시네." ✓ (natural observation with 네)
- Line 79: "아직 일러. 12시에 먹자." ✓ (natural casual)

**Subject omission (appropriately natural):**

- Line 25: "민수야, 케이블 어디 있어?" ✓ (natural)
- Line 27: "케이블? 무슨 케이블?" ✓ (natural echo question)

**Minor note (-1 point):**
- Line 57: "오늘 일찍 왔네?" could be even more natural as "오늘 일찍 왔구나?" or "오늘 일찍이네?" but current form is acceptable.

### Back-Translation Test (Sample)

**5 random dialogue sentences:**
1. Line 11: "지금 뭐 해?"
   - Expected back-translation: "What are you doing now?" → "지금 뭐 해?" ✓

2. Line 21: "아, 그래."
   - Expected: "Oh, okay/I see." → "아, 그래." ✓

3. Line 45: "검출기 데이터를 봐야 해. 테스트 결과가 있어."
   - Expected: "I have to look at detector data. There are test results." → Natural ✓

4. Line 77: "지금 11시네. 점심 먹을까?"
   - Expected: "It's 11 o'clock now. Shall we eat lunch?" → Natural ✓

5. Line 93: "하나야, 같이 가. 우리랑 먹자."
   - Expected: "Hana, let's go together. Let's eat with us." → Natural ✓

**3 sentences with new grammar:**
1. Line 29: "검출기 테스트에 필요해."
   - Tests: 에 (purpose/for) usage ✓

2. Line 45: "검출기 데이터를 봐야 해."
   - Tests: 야 해 (must/have to) ✓

3. Line 33: "3층에 가 볼게."
   - Tests: 볼게 (I'll try/check) ✓

**All back-translations would preserve natural Korean structure.**

## 3. THOROUGH VALIDATION

### Story Consistency Check ✓

- "오후에 다시 테스트해" (Line 53) - Afternoon (retest planned)

**Time logic verification:**
- ✓ Morning → 11 AM → 12 PM lunch plan is logical
- ✓ "오늘 수업이 없어요" (Line 59) - Explains why 하나 arrived early
- ✓ No timeline contradictions

#### Location Tracking:
**Character locations throughout:**

*민수:*
- Lines 5-103: In 연구실 (research lab) - consistent ✓

*지은:*
- Lines 7-23: Enters 연구실, looks for cable
